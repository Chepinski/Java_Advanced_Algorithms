Questions:
What is the Barabasi model and why is it important?
Research DAG (Directed acyclic graphs (for DFS))


Notes:
BFS is important in web crawling.

DFS takes same time whether recursive or iterative.  Java will use stack for both.

DFS = stack (mehr memory friendly)
BFS = queue

toString method can always be overridden

DAG directed acyclic graph..a graph with no directed cycles
topological sort has linear time complexity

Hamiltonian path?

topological order
	find edge with no incoming edges
	then find next edge with no incoming edges
		(edges already counted do not count as an incoming edge)
	repeat until done
	
	gives us the steps in order we have to take to complete a task.
	no task can be completed until the previous steps (incoming edges) are completed

Cycle = we are visiting again a vertex that is being visited
